        <p>Terminal Velocity is a fast, cross-platform note-taking application for the
UNIX terminal, it's a clone of the OS X app <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational
Velocity</a> that runs in a terminal and uses your
<code>$EDITOR</code>.</p>

<h3>Install</h3>

<p>To install Terminal Velocity, run:</p>

<pre><code>pip install terminal_velocity
</code></pre>

<p>Then to launch it just run:</p>

<pre><code>terminal_velocity
</code></pre>

<p>To use a different notes directory, run:</p>

<pre><code>terminal_velocity path/to/your/notes/dir
</code></pre>

<p>To quit the app, press <code>ctrl-x</code>.</p>

<h3>Create Notes</h3>



<p>To create a new note, type a title for the note and hit <code>enter</code>. The note will
be opened in your text editor. As you type the title, the list of notes filters
to show notes that match what you've typed, giving you a chance to open a
related note instead of making a new one.</p>

<h3>Find Notes</h3>



<p>The same text area is used for entering the titles of new notes and for
searching notes. To find and open a note, type some words from the note's title
or contents. The list of notes filters as you type to show only matching notes.
When you see the note that you want, use the <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> arrows to select
it then hit <code>enter</code> to open it. You can also use <code>page up</code> and <code>page down</code> or
mouse clicks to select notes.</p>

<h3>Autocomplete</h3>



<p>If you type the beginning of a note's title (case-insensitive), that note will
be automatically selected in the note list and its title will be autocompleted
in the search box. Whenever a note is selected, just hit <code>enter</code> to open that
note.</p>

<p>If you want to create a new note whose title is a substring of an existing
note's title, then even after you've typed the full title for your new note the
existing note will still be selected by the autocomplete. In this case, you
have to hit <code>ctrl-d</code> or <code>escape</code> to clear the autocomplete selection, then hit
<code>enter</code> to create your note.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>The location of the notes directory, the text editor, the filename extension
for new notes, etc. can be configured using command-line options or a config
file. For details, run:</p>

<pre><code>terminal_velocity -h
</code></pre>

<h3>Syncing</h3>

<p>Since your notes are just a directory of plain text files, it's easy to sync
them using Dropbox, Ubuntu One, Unison, git, etc. Just use a notes directory in
your Dropbox or Ubuntu One directory, in a git repository, etc.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Notes are kept as plain text files in a notes directory (<code>~/Notes</code> by default).</p>

<p>Notes are sorted by modification date, most recently modified at the top.</p>

<p>The search is fuzzy. A note will match a search term if it contains all of the
given search words anywhere in its title or body, the words don't have to
appear consecutively or in the same order.</p>

<p>The search is smart-case. For each search word, if the word is all lower-case
then it will be matched case-insensitively. If the word contains any upper-case
letters then it will be matched case-sensitively.</p>

<p>Subdirectories in your notes directory are searched recursively. To create a
new note in a subdirectory, just give the subdir(s) as part of the note's
title, e.g.: <code>programming/python/How to use decorators in Python</code></p>

<p>You can have note files with different filename extensions. All the files in
your notes directory are searched, regardless of filename extension. To create
a note with a different filename extension use the <code>--extension</code> option.</p>

<p>Terminal Velocity doesn't support renaming or moving notes yet, but you can
move note files (and edit their contents) using other tools, this will not
interfere with Terminal Velocity as long as you don't do it while Terminal
Velocity is running.</p>
