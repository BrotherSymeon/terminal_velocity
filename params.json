It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"Terminal velocity","tagline":"A fast note-taking app for the UNIX terminal","body":"Terminal Velocity is a fast, cross-platform note-taking application for the\r\nUNIX terminal, it's a clone of the OS X app [Notational\r\nVelocity](http://notational.net/) that runs in a terminal and uses your\r\n`$EDITOR`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Insert video here -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nTo install Terminal Velocity, run:\r\n\r\n    pip install terminal_velocity\r\n\r\nThen to launch it just run:\r\n\r\n    terminal_velocity\r\n\r\nTo use a different notes directory, run:\r\n\r\n    terminal_velocity path/to/your/notes/dir\r\n\r\nTo quit the app, press `ctrl-x`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Create Notes\r\n\r\n<!-- Insert screenshot -->\r\n\r\nTo create a new note, type a title for the note and hit `enter`. The note will\r\nbe opened in your text editor. As you type the title, the list of notes filters\r\nto show notes that match what you've typed, giving you a chance to open a\r\nrelated note instead of making a new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Find Notes\r\n\r\n<!-- Insert screenshot -->\r\n\r\nThe same text area is used for entering the titles of new notes and for\r\nsearching notes. To find and open a note, type some words from the note's title\r\nor contents. The list of notes filters as you type to show only matching notes.\r\nWhen you see the note that you want, use the `up` and `down` arrows to select\r\nit then hit `enter` to open it. You can also use `page up` and `page down` or\r\nmouse clicks to select notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Autocomplete\r\n\r\n<!-- Insert screenshot -->\r\n\r\nIf you type the beginning of a note's title (case-insensitive), that note will\r\nbe automatically selected in the note list and its title will be autocompleted\r\nin the search box. Whenever a note is selected, just hit `enter` to open that\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a new note whose title is a substring of an existing\r\nnote's title, then even after you've typed the full title for your new note the\r\nexisting note will still be selected by the autocomplete. In this case, you\r\nhave to hit `ctrl-d` or `escape` to clear the autocomplete selection, then hit\r\n`enter` to create your note.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nThe location of the notes directory, the text editor, the filename extension\r\nfor new notes, etc. can be configured using command-line options or a config\r\nfile. For details, run:\r\n\r\n    terminal_velocity -h\r\n\r\n\r\n### Syncing\r\n\r\nSince your notes are just a directory of plain text files, it's easy to sync\r\nthem using Dropbox, Ubuntu One, Unison, git, etc. Just use a notes directory in\r\nyour Dropbox or Ubuntu One directory, in a git repository, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nNotes are kept as plain text files in a notes directory (`~/Notes` by default).\r\n\r\nNotes are sorted by modification date, most recently modified at the top.\r\n\r\nThe search is fuzzy. A note will match a search term if it contains all of the\r\ngiven search words anywhere in its title or body, the words don't have to\r\nappear consecutively or in the same order.\r\n\r\nThe search is smart-case. For each search word, if the word is all lower-case\r\nthen it will be matched case-insensitively. If the word contains any upper-case\r\nletters then it will be matched case-sensitively.\r\n\r\nSubdirectories in your notes directory are searched recursively. To create a\r\nnew note in a subdirectory, just give the subdir(s) as part of the note's\r\ntitle, e.g.: `programming/python/How to use decorators in Python`\r\n\r\nYou can have note files with different filename extensions. All the files in\r\nyour notes directory are searched, regardless of filename extension. To create\r\na note with a different filename extension use the `--extension` option.\r\n\r\nTerminal Velocity doesn't support renaming or moving notes yet, but you can\r\nmove note files (and edit their contents) using other tools, this will not\r\ninterfere with Terminal Velocity as long as you don't do it while Terminal\r\nVelocity is running.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nUser interaction copied from [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/).\r\n\r\nSome code snippets ideas borrowed from\r\n[Andrew Wagner](https://github.com/drewm1980/nv-console) and\r\n[Simon Greenhill](https://bitbucket.org/simongreenhill/n).\r\n\r\nWritten in [Python](http://www.python.org/) using\r\n[Urwid](http://excess.org/urwid/).\r\n"}
